        <h1>General info</h1> 
  <p>The Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) is a species of South American camelid, similar to, and often confused with the llama. However, alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. The two animals are closely related, and can successfully cross-breed. Alpacas and llamas are also closely related to the Vicu√±a, which is believed to be the alpaca's wild ancestor, and to the Guanaco. There are two breeds of Alpaca: the Suri alpaca (es) and the Huacaya alpaca.

  Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of Southern Peru, Western Bolivia, Ecuador, and Northern Chile at an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft) to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) above sea level, throughout the year.[1] Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be working animal, but are bred specifically for their fiber. Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to wool. These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding in other parts of the world. The fiber comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru, 12 as classified in Australia and 16 as classified in the United States.</p>


    <h2>Spitting</h2>
  <p>Not all alpacas spit, but all are capable of doing so. "Spit" is somewhat euphemistic; occasionally the projectile contains only air and a little saliva, although alpacas commonly bring up acidic stomach contents (generally a green, grassy mix) and project it onto their chosen targets. Spitting is mostly reserved for other alpacas, but an alpaca will also occasionally spit at a human.

  Spitting can result in what is called "sour mouth". Sour mouth is characterized by a loose-hanging lower lip and a gaping mouth.[citation needed]

  Alpacas can spit for several reasons. A female alpaca spits when she's not interested in a male alpaca, typically when she thinks she's already impregnated. Both genders of alpaca keep others away from their food or anything they have their eyes on. Most give a slight warning before spitting, by blowing air out and raising their heads to where it looks like their ears are pinned.

  Alpacas can spit out to ten feet if they need to, for example if the other animal does not back off then it will throw up its stomach contents resulting in a lot of spit.

  A couple signs of stress which can lead to their spitting habits include: humming, a wrinkle under their eye, drooling, rapid breathing, and stomping their feet. When an alpaca is showing any sign of interest or alertness, they tend to sniff their surroundings, watches closely, and they even just stand quietly and stare.[13]

  When it comes to reproduction, they spit because it is a response triggered by the progesterone levels being increased which is associated with the ovulation. </p>
